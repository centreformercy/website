<div><strong>In 1973 in Akita, Japan, a nun, Sr.Agnes Sasagawa received three messages from the Blessed Mother. 
  The third message of 1973 was on the anniversary of the final apparition and message of Fatima in 1917.  
  The messages were approved by Bishop John Ito.  There has been no public announcement of any message since that time, 
  however in October, 2019 Sr. Sasagawa received a message from her angel.
 <br>
  <b>The 1973 Messages</b>
  <br>
The first message, received on July 6, 1973, was a call for prayer and sacrifice for the glory of the Father and salvation of souls.
<br>
  The second message, August 3, 1973, was for prayer, penance and courageous sacrifices to soften the Father's anger.
"Many men in this world afflict the Lord. I desire souls to console Him to soften the anger of the Heavenly Father. I wish, with my Son, for souls who will repair by their suffering and their poverty for the sinners and ingrates."
"In order that the world might know His anger, the Heavenly Father is preparing to inflict a great chastisement on all mankind. With my Son I have intervened so many times to appease the wrath of the Father. I have prevented the coming of calamities by offering Him the sufferings of the Son on the Cross, His Precious Blood, and beloved souls who console Him forming a cohort of victim souls. Prayer, penance and courageous sacrifices can soften the Father's anger. I desire this also from your community...that it love poverty, that it sanctify itself and pray in reparation for the ingratitude and outrages of so many men.
Recite the prayer of the Handmaids of the Eucharist with awareness of its meaning; put it into practice; offer in reparation (whatever God may send) for sins. Let each one endeavor, according to capacity and position, to offer herself entirely to the Lord."
"Even in a secular institute prayer is necessary. Already souls who wish to pray are on the way to being gathered together. Without attaching to much attention to the form, be faithful and fervent in prayer to console the Master."
<br>
  The third message was received on October 13, 1973.
As I told you, if men do not repent and better themselves, the Father will inflict a terrible punishment on all humanity. It will be a punishment greater than the deluge, such as one will never seen before. Fire will fall from the sky and will wipe out a great part of humanity, the good as well as the bad, sparing neither priests nor faithful. The survivors will find themselves so desolate that they will envy the dead. The only arms which will remain for you will be the Rosary and the Sign left by My Son. Each day recite the prayers of the Rosary. With the Rosary, pray for the Pope, the bishops and priests."
"The work of the devil will infiltrate even into the Church in such a way that one will see cardinals opposing cardinals, bishops against bishops. The priests who venerate me will be scorned and opposed by their confreres...churches and altars sacked; the Church will be full of those who accept compromises and the demon will press many priests and consecrated souls to leave the service of the Lord.
"The demon will be especially implacable against souls consecrated to God. The thought of the loss of so many souls is the cause of my sadness. If sins increase in number and gravity, there will be no longer pardon for them"
"With courage, speak to your superior. He will know how to encourage each one of you to pray and to accomplish works of reparation."
"Pray very much the prayers of the Rosary. I alone am able still to save you from the calamities which approach. Those who place their confidence in me will be saved."
The October 6, 2019 Message
Message from a her Angel given to Sr. Agnes Sasagawa, on 6th October, 2019, the opening day of the Amazonian Synod. "Put on ashes and pray a repentant rosary every day. (From her Angel to Sister - & please pray and discern if  this part invites you, too) You must become like a child and make sacrifices every day."
