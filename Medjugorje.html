</div><div>"Dear children, 
</div><div>Sadly, among you, my children, there is so much battle, hatred, personal interests and selfishness. My children, so easily you forget my Son, His words, His love. Faith is being extinguished in many souls, and hearts are being grasped by material things of the world. But my motherly heart knows that there are still those who believe and love, who are seeking how to draw all the closer to my Son, who are tirelessly seeking my Son - then, in this way, they are also seeking me. 
</div><div>These are the humble and the meek with their pain and suffering which they carry in silence with their hopes and, above all, with their faith.
</div><div>These are the apostles of my love.
</div><div>My children, apostles of my love, I am teaching you that my Son is not only asking for continuous prayers, but also for works and feelings - that you believe, that you pray, that with your personal prayers you grow in faith, that you grow in love. To love each other is what He asks for - that is the way to eternal life. My children, do not forget that my Son brought the light to this world, and He brought it to those who wanted to see it and receive it. You be those, because this is the light of truth, peace and love.
</div><div>I am leading you in a motherly way to adore my Son; that you love my Son with me; that your thoughts, words and actions may be directed to My Son - that they may be in His name. Then my heart will be fulfilled. Thank you."

What my Son asks of you is to have a sincere, strong and deep faith - then every way in which you express it is proper. Faith is a most wonderful mystery which is kept in the heart.

</div><div>"Dear children! My motherly heart suffers as I am looking at my children who do not love the truth, those who are hiding it-as I look at my children who do not pray with their feelings and actions. I am sad as I am saying to my Son that many of my children no longer have faith, that they do not know Him-my Son.
</div><div>
</div><div>That is why I call you, apostles of my love: you strive to look to the very depth in human hearts and there you are certain to find the little hidden treasure. To look in this way is mercy from the Heavenly Father. To seek the good even where there is the greatest evil-to strive to comprehend each other and not to judge-that is what my Son is asking of you. And I, as a mother, am calling you to listen to Him.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>My children, the spirit is mightier than the flesh, and, carried by love and actions, it overcomes all obstacles. Do not forget: my Son has loved you and loves you. His love is with you and in you when you are one with Him. He is the light of the world and no one and nothing will be able to stop Him in the final glory.
</div><div>
</div><div>Therefore, apostles of my love, do not be afraid to witness the truth. Witness it with enthusiasm, with works, with love, with your sacrifice, and, above all, in humility. Witness the truth to all those who have not come to know my Son. I will be alongside you. I will encourage you.</div><br><div>Witness the love which never ends because it comes from the Heavenly Father who is eternal and who offers eternity to all of my children. The Spirit of my Son will be alongside you. Anew I am calling you, my children: pray for your shepherds, pray that the love of my Son may lead them. Thank you."</div><div><br></div></h3>

</div><div>“Dear children,&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">with a motherly love I am calling you to open hearts to peace; to open hearts to my Son, so that in your hearts love for my Son may sing, because only out of that love peace comes in the soul.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">My children, I know that you have goodness, I know that you have love – a merciful love, but many of my children still have a closed heart. They think that they can do it without directing their thoughts towards the Heavenly Father who illuminates-towards my Son who is always with you anew in the Eucharist and who desires to listen to you. My children, why do you not speak to Him? The life of each of you is important and precious, because it is a gift from the Heavenly Father for eternity. Therefore, do not ever forget to keep on thanking Him: speak to Him.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">I know, my children, that what is to come afterwards is unknown to you, but when your hereafter comes you will receive all the answers. My motherly love desires that you be ready. My children, by your life keep putting good feelings in the hearts of the people whom you meet, feelings of peace, goodness, love and forgiveness. Through prayer, hearken to what My Son is saying and act accordingly.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Anew, I am calling you to prayer for your shepherds, for those whom my Son has called.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Remember that they need prayers and love. Thank you.”&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div></h3>

</div><div>You, with pure and simple souls comprehend—even if sometimes you do not understand the words—and within yourselves you feel what the truth is My children, do not lose the truth and true life so as to follow the false one. By life in truth, the Kingdom of Heaven enters into your hearts, and that is the Kingdom of peace, love and harmony.
</div><div>
</div><div>Then, my children, there will not be the selfishness which distances you from my Son. There will be love and understanding for your neighbours. Because, remember, again I repeat to you, to pray also means to love others, your neighbours, and to give yourself to them. Love and give in my Son, and then He will work in you and for you.

<div>My earthly life was simple.

</div><div>My children,</div><div>I had the strength of faith and boundless trust in God’s love.
</div><div>All those who have the strength of faith are stronger.
</div><div>Faith makes you live according to what is good and then the light of God’s love always comes at the desired moment.
</div><div>That is the strength which sustains in pain and suffering.
</div><div>My children, pray for the strength of faith, trust in the Heavenly Father, and do not be afraid.
</div><div>Know that not a single creature who belongs to God will be lost but will live forever.
</div><div>Every pain has its end and then life in freedom begins there where all of my children come – where everything is returned.
</div><div>My children, your battle is difficult.
</div><div>It will be even more difficult, but you follow my example.  
</div><div>Pray for the strength of faith;</div><div>trust in the love of the Heavenly Father.
</div><div>I am with you.
</div><div>I am manifesting myself to you.
</div><div>I am encouraging you.

</div><div>He is speaking to you. 
</div><div>Why do you not desire to see the signs?

</div><div>My children, I am speaking to you, my voice is speaking to your soul, my heart is speaking to your heart. 
</div><div>Oh, apostles of my love, how much my motherly heart loves you. 
</div><div>How many things I desire to teach you. 
</div><div>How my motherly heart desires that you be complete, and you can be complete only when your soul,</div><div>body and love are united within you.
