PLEASE NOTE:<br />
 -After the March 18, 2020 annual apparition to Mirjana,

	month, but only on March 18.

 -When Ivan was in St. Louis in 2013 at Our Lady of Sorrows, he requested that we all pray a Hail Mary every day for the visionaries.

<div>"Dear children! 
</div><div>
Also today Jesus is here beside you, even when you think that you are alone and that light does not exist in your life. 
			He is here and has never left you or distanced Himself from you. 
			The light of His birth illuminates this world and your life His Heart is always open towards you, to receive your every pain, 
			every trial, fear and need. His arms are extended towards you, that as a father, 
			He may embrace you and tell you how important you are for Him, how much He loves you and cares for His children. 
			Children, is your heart open towards Jesus? Have you completely surrendered your life into His hands? 
			Have you accepted Jesus as your father, to whom you can always turn and in Him find consolation and everything you need to live true faith? 
			Therefore, my children, surrender your hearts to Jesus and permit Him to begin to rule your lives, because only in this way, 
			will you accept the present and be able to face the world in which you live today.  
			With Jesus, every fear, suffering and pain disappear, because your heart accepts His will and everything that comes into your life. 
			Jesus will give you the faith to accept everything and nothing will distance you from Him -- because He firmly holds you by the hand 
			and does not permit for you to distance and lose yourselves in difficult moments -- because He has become the Lord of your life. 
			I bless you with my motherly blessing‚Äù

<div>"Dear children! 
</div><div>
This is a time of love, warmth, prayer and joy. Pray, little children, for little Jesus to be born in your hearts. Open your hearts to Jesus who gives Himself to each of you. God sent me to be joy and hope in this time, and I am saying to you: Without little Jesus you do not have the tenderness or the feeling of Heaven which is hidden in the Newborn. Therefore, little children, work on yourselves. By reading the Sacred Scripture you will discover Jesus' birth and joy, as in the first days which Medjugorje gave to humanity. History will be truth which, also today, is being repeated in you and around you. Work on and build peace through the Sacrament of Confession. Reconcile with God, little children, and you will see miracles around you. Thank you for having responded to my call.‚Äù

<div>"Dear children! 
</div><div>Pray with  me for a new  life for  all of you.  In your hearts , little children,  you know what needs to be changed. Return to  God and  His  Commandments,   so that the  Holy Spirit  may  change  your  lives and the face of  this earth,  which is  in need of  renewal  in the  spirit.  Little children,  be  prayer for all those who  do not  pray; be joy for all  those  who  do  not  see the way  out; be carriers of light in the  darkness  of  this  peaceless time. Pray and seek the  help and  protection of the  saints so that you  also could yearn for Heaven  and Heavenly  realities.  I am with you and am protecting and blessing all of you with  my motherly  blessing. Thank you for having responded to my call"</div><div><br></div></h3>

</div><div>This is a time of gratitude, today I seek love from you, do not look for mistakes in others and do not judge others.
I ask that you love, that you convey the truth, because the truth is eternal, immutable, and always current!
Bear the light of my Son and break the darkness that increasingly wants to grasp and take you away from my Son.
Have no fear I‚Äôm with you.

<div>"Dear children!

My Son as God has always looked beyond time. I, as His mother, through Him, see in time. 
I see beautiful and sad things. But I see that there is still love and that it needs doing to make it known.
My children, you cannot be happy if you do not love one another, 
if you do not have love in every situation and in every moment of your life. 
I, as a Mother, come to you through love-to help you to know true love, to know my Son. 
That is why I am calling you anew to yearn for love, faith and hope again and again. 
The only source you can drink from is trust in God, my Son.
My children, in times of turmoil and renunciation, you only seek the face of my Son. 
You just live His words and don‚Äôt be afraid. 
Pray and love with sincere feelings, good works, and help the world change so that my heart triumphs.
My Son and I tell you to love one another, because without love there is no salvation.
Thank you, my children"</div><div><br></div></h3>

Your pure and sincere love draws my motherly heart. Your faith and trust in the Heavenly Father are fragrant roses which you offer to me-the most beautiful bouquets of roses which consist of your prayers, acts of mercy and of love.
Apostles of my love, you who sincerely and with a pure heart strive to follow my Son, you who sincerely love Him, you help; you be an example to those who have not yet come to know the love of my Son-but, my children, not only with words but also with acts and pure feelings through which you glorify the Heavenly Father.
Apostles of my love, it is a time of vigilance, and of you I am asking for love, that you not judge-anyone. Because the Heavenly Father will judge everyone.
I am asking that you love, that you convey the truth; because truth is old, it is not new, it is eternal, it is truth. It testifies to God‚Äôs eternity. Bring the light of my Son and keep breaking the darkness which all the more wants to seize you. Do not be afraid. Through the grace and the love of my Son, I am with you. Thank you."</div><div><br></div></h3>

By the act of the decision and love of God, I am chosen to be the Mother of God and your mother. But also by my will and my immeasurable love for the Heavenly Father and my complete trust in Him, my body was the chalice of the God-man.
I was in the service of truth, love and salvation, as I am now among you to call you, my children, apostles of my love, to be carriers of truth; to call you to spread His words, the words of salvation, by your will and love for my Son: that with your actions you may show, to all those who have not come to know my Son, His love.
You will find strength in the Eucharist-my Son who feeds you with His Body and strengthens you with His Blood. My children, fold your hands [in prayer] and look at the Cross in silence. In this way, you are drawing faith to be able to transmit it; you are drawing truth to be able to discern; you are drawing love that you may know to love truly. My children, apostles of my love, fold your hands [in prayer], look at the Cross. Only in the Cross is salvation.

   I know that I am present in your lives and in your hearts. I feel your love, I hear your prayers and direct them to my Son. But, my children, according to motherly love, I desire to be in the lives of all of my children. I desire to gather all of my children around me, beneath my motherly mantle. This is why I am inviting you and calling you, apostles of my love, to help me.

My children, my Son pronounced the words of the ‚ÄòOur Father‚Äô-Our Father, [you] who are everywhere and in our hearts-because He desires to teach you to pray with words and feelings. He desires for you to always be better, to live merciful love which is prayer and limitless sacrifice for others.
My children, give to my Son love for your neighbors, give words of consolation, compassion and acts of justice to your neighbors. Everything that you give to others, apostles of my love, my Son accepts as a gift. I am also with you, because my Son desires for my love, as a ray of light, to bring your souls to life; for me to help you in the search for peace and eternal happiness. Therefore, my children, love one another, be united through my Son, be children of God who all together, with full, open and pure heart, pronounce the ‚ÄòOur Father‚Äô. And do not be afraid!
