<div>"Dear children! 
</div><div>
   As I am looking at you who love my Son, my heart is being filled with tenderness. I am blessing you with a motherly blessing. With a motherly blessing, I am also blessing your shepherds – you who speak the words of my Son, who bless with His hands and who love Him so much that you are ready to make every sacrifice for Him with joy.
You are following Him, who was the first shepherd, the first missionary. My children, apostles of my love, to live and work for others, for all those whom you love through my Son, is the joy and comfort of earthly life. If through prayer, love and sacrifice the Kingdom of God is in your hearts, then your life is joyful and bright. Among those who love my Son and who love each other through Him, words are not necessary.
A gaze is sufficient for the unspoken words and unexpressed feelings to be heard. There where love reigns, time no longer counts. We are with you. My Son knows you and loves you. Love is that which brings you to me and through that love I will come to you and speak to you of the works of salvation.
I desire for all of my children to have faith and to feel my motherly love which leads them to Jesus. Therefore, you, my children, wherever you go, illuminate with love and faith as apostles of love. 

                 Thank you."</div><div><br></div></h3>

The world is at war because hearts are full of hatred and jealousy. In the eyes, little children, peacelessness is seen because you have not permitted Jesus to be born in your lives. Seek Him, pray, and He will give Himself to you in the Child who is joy and peace.
I am with you and I pray for you.

My beloved Son always prayed and glorified the Heavenly Father. He always said everything to Him and trusted in His will. This is what you, my children, should also do, because the Heavenly Father always listens to His children. One heart in one heart - love, light and life.
The Heavenly Father gave Himself through a human face, and this face is the face of my Son. You, apostles of my love, you should always carry the face of my Son in your hearts and your thoughts. You should always think of His love and His sacrifice. You should pray to always feel His presence, because, apostles of my love, that is the way for you to help all those who do not know my Son, who have not come to know His love.
My children, read the book of the Gospel. It is always something new, it is what binds you to my Son who was born to bring the words of life to all of my children and to sacrifice Himself for all. Apostles of my love, carried by the love for my Son, bring love and peace to all of your brothers. Judge no one. Love everyone according to the love for my Son. In this way, you will also be caring for your soul, and it [your soul] is that what is most precious, which truly belongs to you. Thank you."</div><div><br></div></h3>

"I would like to briefly describe the meeting tonight with the Madonna. Our Lady came to us very joyful and happy, 
and greeted us all with her maternal greeting: “Praised be Jesus, my dear children!” 
Then she prayed for all of the sick people present. Then she prayed over us all with her hands extended. 
Today Our Lady paused to pray for a prolonged time, especially for peace, for peace in the world. 
She also invites us, especially at this time, to pray for peace.

Then she gave us her motherly blessing and blessed everything brought for her to be blessed. 
Then I recommended all of you: your needs, your intentions, your families and in particular all of you, priests present, 
and your intentions.

Then Our Lady continued to pray here about us all and in this prayer she left, 
in the sign of light and of the cross, with the greeting: “Go in peace, my dear children!”

I would like to stress again that Our Lady prayed for a prolonged time for world peace. "</div><div><br></div></h3>

The will and the love of the Heavenly Father make it so that I am among you, that I, with a motherly love, may help the growth of faith in your heart, for you to be able to truly comprehend the purpose of earthly life and the greatness of the heavenly one.
My children, the earthly life is the way to eternity, to truth, and to life-to my Son.
I desire to lead you on that way. You, my children-you who always thirst for more love, truth, and faith-need to know that there is only one spring from which you can drink. It is trust in the Heavenly Father; it is trust in His love.
Abandon yourselves completely to His will and do not be afraid. Everything that is best for you, everything that leads you to eternal life, will be given to you. You will comprehend that the purpose of life is not always to want and take, but to love and give. You will have true peace and true love. You will be apostles of love.
By your example, you will make it so that those children who do not know my Son and His love may desire to come to know Him.
My children, apostles of my love, adore my Son with me and love Him above all. Always strive to live in His truth. Thank you.”"</div><div><br></div></h3>

In this way, you will have the experience of faith like Peter who met Jesus and the Holy Spirit filled his heart. Little children, you are also called to witness by living the love with which, day by day, God wraps you with my presence.
Therefore, little children, be open and pray with the heart in faith.

<div>"Dear children! 
</div><div>Pray! Pray the Rosary every day-that wreath of flowers which, as a mother, directly connects me with your pains, sufferings, desires, and hopes.
Apostles of my love, I am with you through the grace and the love of my Son, and I am asking for prayers of you. The world is in such need of your prayers for souls to be converted. With complete trust, open your hearts to my Son, and in them He will inscribe the summary of His words-which is love. Live in an unbreakable connection with the Most Sacred Heart of my Son.
My children, as a mother, I am telling you that it is high time for you to kneel before my Son to acknowledge Him as your God, the center of your life. Offer gifts to Him-that which He most loves-which is love towards neighbor, mercy, and pure hearts.
Apostles of my love, many of my children still do not acknowledge my Son as their God; they have not yet come to know His love. But you, with your prayer pronounced from a pure and open heart, by the gifts which you offer to my Son, will make even the hardest hearts open.
Apostles of my love, the strength of prayer pronounced from the heart-a powerful prayer full of love-changes the world. Therefore, my children: pray, pray, pray. I am with you. Thank you.."</div><div><br></div></h3>

<div>"Dear children! 
</div><div>The love of my Son is great. If you could know the greatness of His love, you would never stop worshiping Him and thanking Him. He is always alive with you in the Eucharist, because the Eucharist is his heart, the Eucharist is the heart of faith. He never abandoned you: even when you tried to get away from Him, He never did.
Therefore, my maternal heart is happy when it sees how full of love you return to Him, when it sees that you return to Him through the path of reconciliation, love and hope. My maternal heart knows that if you walk on the path of faith, you would be like buds, and through prayer and fasting you would be like fruit, like flowers, apostles of my love, you would be the bearer of light and light with love and wisdom all around you.
My children, as a mother, I pray that you: pray, think and contemplate. Everything that happens to you, beautiful, painful and joyful, all that makes you grow spiritually, let my Son grow in you. My children, abandon yourselves to Him. Believe Him and trust in His love. May He guide you. May the Eucharist be the place where you will nourish your souls and then spread love and truth. Witness my Son. Thank you”.</div><div><br></div></h3>

<div>"Dear children! 
</div><div>Dear children, according to the will of the merciful Father, I have given you, and will still give you, evident signs of my motherly presence. My children, this is a motherly desire for the healing of souls. This is a desire that every child of mine may have true faith, to live to see wondrous experiences, drinking from the spring of the words of my Son-the words of life. 
My children, my Son, by His love and sacrifice, brought the light of faith into the world and showed you the way of faith. Because, my children, faith elevates pain and suffering. True faith makes prayer more sensitive, and does acts of mercy-a conversation, a gift of alms. Those of my children who have faith-true faith-are happy despite everything because they live the beginning of heavenly happiness on earth. Therefore, my children, apostles of my love, I am calling you to give an example of true faith, to bring light where there is darkness, to live my Son. 
My children, as a mother I am telling you: you cannot go on the way of faith and follow my Son without your shepherds. Pray that they may have the strength and the love to lead you. May your prayers always be alongside them. Thank you."</div><div><br></div></h3>

Only love will make you comprehend that it is stronger than death because true love conquered death and made it so that death not exist.
My children, forgiveness is the most exalted form of love. You, as apostles of my love, must pray that you be strong in spirit and that you could comprehend and forgive. You, apostles of my love, by understanding and forgiveness, are giving an example of love and mercy. To be able to comprehend and forgive is a gift for which it is necessary to pray, and to nurture it.
By forgiveness you are showing that you know how to love. Just look, my children, how the Heavenly Father loves you with a great love, with understanding, forgiveness and justice-how He gives me, the Mother of your hearts, to you. And here I am among you to bless you with a motherly blessing, to call you to prayer, to fasting-to tell you to believe, to hope, to forgive, to pray for your shepherds, and above all to love without limits.
My children, follow me. My way is the way of peace and love, the way of my Son. It is the way that leads to the triumph of my heart. Thank you."</div><div><br></div></h3>

           of the Heavenly Father—a big smile filled with the love of my Son, a call to eternal life. 
           Out of love, the Blood of my Son was shed for you. That Precious Blood is for your salvation, for eternal life. 
           The Heavenly Father created man for eternal happiness. It is not possible—for you who know the love of my Son and 
           who follow Him—to die. Life triumphed; my Son is alive. Therefore, my children, apostles of my love, may prayer
           show you the way and the means of spreading the love of my Son—prayer in the most exalted form. 
           My children, also when you strive to live the words of my Son, you are praying. 
           When you love the people whom you meet, you are spreading the love of my Son. 
           It is love that opens the doors of Paradise. 
           My children, from the beginning, I prayed for the Church. Therefore, I am also calling you, apostles of my love, 
           to pray for the Church and her servants—for those whom my Son called. Thank you."</div><div><br></div></h3>

</div><div>"Dear children, 
</div><div>Sadly, among you, my children, there is so much battle, hatred, personal interests and selfishness. My children, so easily you forget my Son, His words, His love. Faith is being extinguished in many souls, and hearts are being grasped by material things of the world. But my motherly heart knows that there are still those who believe and love, who are seeking how to draw all the closer to my Son, who are tirelessly seeking my Son - then, in this way, they are also seeking me. 
</div><div>These are the humble and the meek with their pain and suffering which they carry in silence with their hopes and, above all, with their faith.
</div><div>These are the apostles of my love.
</div><div>My children, apostles of my love, I am teaching you that my Son is not only asking for continuous prayers, but also for works and feelings - that you believe, that you pray, that with your personal prayers you grow in faith, that you grow in love. To love each other is what He asks for - that is the way to eternal life. My children, do not forget that my Son brought the light to this world, and He brought it to those who wanted to see it and receive it. You be those, because this is the light of truth, peace and love.
</div><div>I am leading you in a motherly way to adore my Son; that you love my Son with me; that your thoughts, words and actions may be directed to My Son - that they may be in His name. Then my heart will be fulfilled. Thank you."
