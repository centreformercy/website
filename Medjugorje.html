</div><div><br></div><div>This is the greatest happiness—the hands of my Son that embrace, of Him who loves the soul, of Him who has given Himself for you and is always giving Himself anew in the Eucharist, of Him who has the words of eternal life. To come to know His love,&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">to follow in His footsteps,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">means to have a wealth of spirituality.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>This is the wealth which gives good feelings and sees love and goodness everywhere. Apostles of my love, my children, be like the rays of the sun which with the warmth of my Son’s love warm everyone around them. My children, the world needs apostles of love; the world needs much prayer, but prayer spoken with the heart and the soul and not only pronounced with the lips.
</div><div><br></div><div>My children, long for holiness but in humility, in the humility which permits my Son to do that which He desires through you. My children, your prayers, your words, thoughts and actions—all of this either opens or closes the doors</div><div>to the Kingdom of Heaven for you.
</div><div><br></div><div>My Son showed you the way and gave you hope, and I am consoling and encouraging you because, my children, I had come to know pain, but I had faith and hope. Now I have the reward of life in the Kingdom of my Son. Therefore, listen to me, have courage and do not grow weary. Thank you.”</div></h3>

They think that they can do it without directing their thoughts towards the Heavenly Father who illuminates-towards my Son who is always with you anew in the Eucharist and who desires to listen to you. My children, why do you not speak to Him? The life of each of you is important and precious, because it is a gift from the Heavenly Father for eternity. Therefore, do not ever forget to keep on thanking Him: speak to Him.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">

My motherly love desires that you be ready. My children, by your life keep putting good feelings in the hearts of the people whom you meet, feelings of peace, goodness, love and forgiveness. Through prayer, hearken to what My Son is saying and act accordingly.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">

</div><div>
</div><div>You, with pure and simple souls comprehend—even if sometimes you do not understand the words—and within yourselves you feel what the truth is My children, do not lose the truth and true life so as to follow the false one. By life in truth, the Kingdom of Heaven enters into your hearts, and that is the Kingdom of peace, love and harmony.
</div><div>
</div><div>Then, my children, there will not be the selfishness which distances you from my Son. There will be love and understanding for your neighbours.

</div><div><br></div><div>A joy-a light indescribable in human words-will penetrate your soul and the peace and love of my Son will take hold of you. I desire this for all of my children. Therefore, you, apostles of my love, you who know how to love and forgive, you who do not judge, you whom I encourage, you be an example to all those who are not going on the way of light and love or who have diverted from it. By your life show them the truth.  Show them love because love overcomes all difficulties, and all of my children thirst for love. Your unity in love is a gift to my Son and me. But, my children, remember that to love also means to desire the good for your neighbor and to desire conversion of your neighbor's soul.
</div><div>As I am looking at you gathered around me, my heart is sad, because I see so little brotherly love, merciful love.
</div><div><br></div><div>My children, the Eucharist-my Son alive among you-His words will help you comprehend, because His word is life, His word makes the soul breathe, His word brings about cognition of love.
</div><div>Dear children, anew, I am imploring you as a mother who desires the good for her children: love your shepherds, pray for them. Thank you."
