<div>"Dear children! 
</div><div>With a motherly love I am calling you to respond to the great love of my Son, with pure and open hearts, 
           with complete trust. I know the greatness of His love. I carried Him within me, the Host in the heart, 
           the light and the love of the world. My children, also my addressing you is a sign of the love and tenderness
           of the Heavenly Father—a big smile filled with the love of my Son, a call to eternal life. 
           Out of love, the Blood of my Son was shed for you. That Precious Blood is for your salvation, for eternal life. 
           The Heavenly Father created man for eternal happiness. It is not possible—for you who know the love of my Son and 
           who follow Him—to die. Life triumphed; my Son is alive. Therefore, my children, apostles of my love, may prayer
           show you the way and the means of spreading the love of my Son—prayer in the most exalted form. 
           My children, also when you strive to live the words of my Son, you are praying. 
           When you love the people whom you meet, you are spreading the love of my Son. 
           It is love that opens the doors of Paradise. 
           My children, from the beginning, I prayed for the Church. Therefore, I am also calling you, apostles of my love, 
           to pray for the Church and her servants—for those whom my Son called. Thank you."</div><div><br></div></h3>

You, little children, are called to be love and prayer. The devil wants peacelessness and disorder, but you, little children, be the joy of the risen Jesus who died and resurrected for each of you. He conquered death to give you life, eternal life. Therefore, little children, witness and be proud that you have resurrected in Him.

That is why I, as a mother, through the love of God, am addressing you and calling you that, by prayer and a pure and open heart within yourselves, you may come to know my Son - His love, His merciful heart. My Son saw beauty in all things. 
He seeks the good in all souls-even that which is little and hidden-so as to forgive evil. Therefore, my children, apostles of my love, I am calling you to adore Him, to ceaselessly give Him thanks, and to be worthy. Because He has spoken to you divine words, the words of God, the words which are for all and forever. 
Therefore, my children, live joy, radiance, unity and mutual love. This is what you need in today's world. In this way you will be apostles of my love. In this way you will witness my Son in the right way.

Little children, you are empty and do not have joy, because you do not have God. Therefore, pray until prayer becomes your life.
In nature seek God who created you, because nature speaks and fights for life and not for death. Wars are reigning in hearts and nations, because you do not have peace and you do not see, little children, a brother in your neighbor.

My children, my Son knows you.
He lived the life of man, and at the same time of God: a wondrous life-human flesh, divine Spirit.
Therefore, my children, while my Son is looking at you with His eyes of God, He penetrates into your hearts.
His tender, warm eyes are looking for Himself in your heart.
My children, can He find Himself [there]?
Accept Him, and then the moments of pain and suffering will become moments of tenderness.
Accept Him, and you will have peace in [your] soul-you will spread it to all those around you-and this is what you now need the most.
Heed me, my children.
Pray for the shepherds, for those whose hands my Son has blessed.
Thank you."</div><div><br></div></h3>

You are asking of Him to be good to you and to forgive you, and for how long am I imploring you, my children, to forgive and to love all the people whom you meet?

</div><div>My Son gives Himself to you and breaks the bread with you. He speaks the words of eternal life to you so that you may carry them to everyone. And you, my children, apostles of my love, what are you afraid of when my Son is with you? Offer your souls to Him so that He can be in them and that He can make you instruments of faith, instruments of love.
</div><div>
</div><div>My children, live the Gospel, live merciful love for your neighbors, and, above all, live love for the Heavenly Father. My children, you are not united by chance. The Heavenly Father does not unite anyone by chance.
</div><div>
</div><div>My Son speaks to your souls. I speak to your heart. As a mother I am saying to you: set out with me, love one another, give witness. Do not be afraid, with your example, to defend the truth-the Word of God which is eternal and never changes. My children, whoever acts in the light of merciful love and truth is always helped by Heaven and is not alone.

</div><div>"Dear children, 
</div><div>Sadly, among you, my children, there is so much battle, hatred, personal interests and selfishness. My children, so easily you forget my Son, His words, His love. Faith is being extinguished in many souls, and hearts are being grasped by material things of the world. But my motherly heart knows that there are still those who believe and love, who are seeking how to draw all the closer to my Son, who are tirelessly seeking my Son - then, in this way, they are also seeking me. 
</div><div>These are the humble and the meek with their pain and suffering which they carry in silence with their hopes and, above all, with their faith.
</div><div>These are the apostles of my love.
</div><div>My children, apostles of my love, I am teaching you that my Son is not only asking for continuous prayers, but also for works and feelings - that you believe, that you pray, that with your personal prayers you grow in faith, that you grow in love. To love each other is what He asks for - that is the way to eternal life. My children, do not forget that my Son brought the light to this world, and He brought it to those who wanted to see it and receive it. You be those, because this is the light of truth, peace and love.
</div><div>I am leading you in a motherly way to adore my Son; that you love my Son with me; that your thoughts, words and actions may be directed to My Son - that they may be in His name. Then my heart will be fulfilled. Thank you."
