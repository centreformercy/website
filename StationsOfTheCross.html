                    History of the<br>Stations of the Cross&nbsp;<br>Medjugorje, 2016</h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">
                    JESUS directed us in October, 2016, to video the Stations of the Cross, in Medjugorje, Bosnia~Hercegovina. &nbsp;The weather for almost 2 1/2 weeks was very unusual for that time of the year and mostly rainy. Continually, I tried to be alert and pray, "LORD, Your will be done". I made the contacts; I waited and prayed. After the 1st week, I surrendered it all to Our LORD and Our Lady, "LORD, this is Your request and I am here because of You. If You desire this to be accomplished, then You'll have to take care of everything".<br>Two weeks passed by and still I waited. After the last weekend was slipping away, I was leaving early Tuesday morning ~ still trying to be hopeful. They were predicting rain through the weekend until I left. You cannot easily climb Cross Mountain when raining or immediately after a rain because the rocks are so slippery.<br>Early Monday morning, during the darkness of the night, the LORD woke me up. As I opened my eyes, the moon was beaming into my bedroom. "I'm with you," JESUS said. I got up and saw that it was very clear and it renewed my hope of possibly accomplishing JESUS' request on my last full day. In the morning, my contact said that there may be someone available to video - I would know after 10 am Mass. Again, "hope springs eternal" - my contact had a smiling face after Mass and it was<br>"Yes, meet at 1 pm (1300 Our Lady's number). &nbsp;<br>We began the climb ~ GOD is so awesome!<br>At the secnd station the shadow of the Cross was shown on the Station. &nbsp;At the fourth station, there the sun was so brilliant ~reminding us that Our Lady comes in a warm, glowing light. &nbsp;JESUS: "every one can live their life without knowing My/Our Mother, but their life will not be complete."<br>Then notice the 'following sun' in the various stations.<br>The LORD continued, "I desired that there be no spoken words or muusic. &nbsp;I will speak to every one's heart. &nbsp;I desire that you send it out to all the world. &nbsp;When you walk with Me in the Stations of the Crossin My Life, you better understand how I walk wiyh you in the stations of your life. &nbsp;The stations will be very important in the future."&nbsp;<br>The Crucifix placed on the remembrance stone of Father Slavko, was hand-made in Medjugorje. &nbsp;In October, 2017, the Lord asked us to carry this Crucifix with us as we pilgrims walked up the mountain and prayed the Stations of the Cross.<br><br><br>The crucifix was to be then placed and shown in the video, so that those who gathered to pray the stations would venerate this Crucifix ~ as if they had been praying and meditating on the Stations in Medjugorje.&nbsp;<br><br>Please help JESUS in sharing His mission&nbsp;<br>"Go out to All the world" by sharing His Life.</h3>
