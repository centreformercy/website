                    INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">Let me tell you about Susie.
<br><div>
</div><div>Susie entered my life in October of 2005.  I head about her before she heard about me. When she heard of me, she chose me.  No, in the words of Is 42, she “grasped” me.&nbsp;
</div><div><br></div><div>Let me back up a bit.
</div><div>
</div><div>I was a missionary in Bolivia from 1978-1982.  I have since learned that I am a missionary “of Bolivia” for the rest of my life.  Because of this experience I like belonging to a group whom we affectionately and playfully call the “S.O.B.’s  (“Survivors of Bolivia.”)
</div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">A fellow and generous “S.O.B.” has assumed the role of e-mail contact person for us and he mentioned in that eventful e-mail of October, 2005 that Suzie had contacted colon cancer metastasized to the liver and could use our prayers.&nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Susie, an Asian-Bolivian, was married to Jack, a fellow “S.O.B.” whom I remembered as a gracious host in my initial contact with Bolivia, visiting my brother in La Paz in June of 1970.   I had no contact with Jack after that time and had never known Susie.&nbsp;</span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Since I was in treatment for the same cancer as Susie, I e-mailed her about such and told her that I would offer up my trials of taking chemotherapy for her.&nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">That’s when Susie “grasped” me.  Susie called me to say “thanks.”  Susie called me weekly to share our experiences.  Susie sent me three books that changed my life.  Susie evoked an urge in me that I had to meet her.  It just wasn’t enough to connect via our Sunday night telephone calls.  Susie urged Jack to call me when she became too weak to do it herself.&nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Susie died in September of 2006 the night before I departed for my scheduled visit to her home in New Jersey.  In God’s mystery I was not meant to meet her in person.&nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"></span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Susie, whom I never met alive, continues to this day to support me and shape my life through an “Invisible Embrace of Beauty,” the title of one of the three books that she sent me.&nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">See what I mean about “grasping” my hand?  Quite rightly you ask, “and what did you do to develop this special life-changing relationship?”   All I can say is that I initiated contact through that simple but eventful e-mail and slowly but finally “grasped” her hand as tightly as she had grasped mine from the very beginning.&nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">So why have I told you this story?  Because Susie has helped me to see all the ways that God has “grasped my hand” and called me to use me in my weakest hour.&nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">In March of 2006 I did not think that I would live to see the end of the year.  I did my best to say “yes” to that real possibility of death to this earth with hope.  Through God’s grace my “yes” was accompanied by a flood of consolation and attraction to the glorious light on the “other side’ and glimpses of the radiance of that light emanating from all of creation here below.&nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">That “yes,” flood of consolation, and Susie’s “grasp” are the essence of the spark of inspiration that came to me in prayer that composed the “Daily Seven.”  I thank that the elements of the “Daily Seven” were the structure that God formed in me and around me and served me to awaken me to a new life.  A new life full of the wonder and ambition for new possibilities to bring to the world with a zeal and naiveté most often associated with the age of the youth.&nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">My hope is that the “Daily Seven” will be a similar gift for you.  I hope that you will be able to discover a youthful wonder and zest for new possibilities in your life and will be shed of all that encumbers your mind and spirit that keeps you bound to the predicable and ordinary. I mean that rut that we so easily get into that so often ends up being living the life of others' expectations for you rather than the expression of your authentic Divine-gifted inner self.&nbsp;</span></div></h3>
